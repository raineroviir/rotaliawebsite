<p>The Rotalia Foundation was founded in 1982 by late Gerhart Treuberg, an Estonian immigrant, residing in Seattle, Washington.  Gerhart Treuberg named the foundation "Rotalia Foundation" based on his life-long membership in the Rotalia Fraternity in Tartu and Tallinn Universities and in Seattle.  Gerhard Treuberg passed away in 1987 and in his will, he bequeathed his estate to the newly created Rotalia Foundation.

<p>Rotalia Foundation, as stated earlier, is a non-profit charitable corporation, governed by a twelve-member Board of Directors.  After every two years, Directors elect a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Treasurer and a Secretary. The Chairman is also the Managing Director, tasked to carry out the policies of the Foundation and the directives of the Board of Directors.  The Foundation's structure is outlined in the Articles of Incorporation and the operating procedures are outlined in the By-Laws.  The founding documents authorize the Foundation to receive gifts and donations, borrow money, and make grants in accordance with its Articles of Incorporation.  Grant making is limited to other non-profit charitable corporations (domestic and foreign), which have been granted Section 501(c)3 certification by the IRS.  Operating procedures are outlined in the By-Laws, which have been amended twice, since the inception of the Foundation.  During its 35 years of operation, the Foundation has never faced a challenge in a court of law, nor questioned or audited by state or federal auditors.  The Foundation's funds are invested with Morgan Stanley, Smith, Investment Bankers, resulting in an average investment returns ranging from 5 to 8 percent per year.  The Foundation's legal counsel is Davis Wright Tremaine LLP of Seattle.  The roster of the current Board of Directors can be found in tab Board of Directors.</p>
